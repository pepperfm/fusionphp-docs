## Quick Start

*Fusion expects to be installed in a Laravel application that uses Inertia*. In the future we might not have that stipulation, but for now it needs to be an Inertia application.

If you want to play with a Fusion app without creating your own, you can clone the [FusionCasts](https://github.com/fusion-php/fusioncasts){target="_blank"} repo.

To install Fusion into your application, you must first require it from Packagist:

```bash [Terminal]
composer r fusionphp/fusion
```

Then you can run the installation command:

```bash [Terminal]
php artisan fusion:install
```

The installation command will do the following:

- Publish the `config/fusion.php` file
- Make sure the correct storage directory exists
- Add the Vue package to your `package.json`
- Add a `fusion:install` script and modify the `postinstall` script to call it
- Add the Vue plugin to your `resources/js/app.js`
- Add the Vite plugin to your `vite.config.js`
- Add a post-update-cmd to your `composer.json`
- Migrate Fusion's internal SQLite database

Fusion creates `[original]`.backup files for each file it modifies, in case it messes your file up in any way. You're free to delete those once you're comfortable with the modifications.
