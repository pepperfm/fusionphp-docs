## Running

You may now run Vite by running `npm run dev`. Fusion will run as a part of the Vite toolchain. (A Vite plugin was added by the `fusion:install` Artisan command.)

Thanks to the Vite plugin, every `<php>` block gets extracted from the `.vue` single file components (SFCs.) More in-depth information on the entire process can be seen at the bottom of the page.
