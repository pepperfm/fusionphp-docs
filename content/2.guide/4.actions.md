On the backend, along with state, you can declare "actions." Actions are a way for the JavaScript frontend to reach over the network and call functions on your backend. In the class-based approach, any method that you define as a `public` method will be exposed to the frontend.
```php
new class 
{
    public function hello() 
    {
        // Do something
    }
}
```
We'll talk further down about calling these methods from your JavaScript, but now on the frontend you have a `hello` function that will route to this method on the backend.

If, for whatever reason, you don't want a public method to be reachable from the frontend, you can add a `ServerOnly` attribute to it in class-based PHP.
```php
new class 
{
    #[\Fusion\Attributes\ServerOnly]
    public function hello() 
    {
        // This method is not addressable from the frontend.
    }
}
```
In procedural PHP, you may pass the function as a named argument to the `expose` method and that will make it visible to the frontend.
```php
expose(hello: function() {
    // This is available on the frontend as `hello`.
})
```
