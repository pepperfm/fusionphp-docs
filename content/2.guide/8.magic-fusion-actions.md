In addition to defining your own actions by exposing public methods on the backend, there is also the concept of a "Fusion provided function."

Currently, Fusion provides one function and it is called `sync`. It is available as a part of the `fusion` object that you may import from `useFusion` or you may just use in your template. All of the Fusion provided functions have the same internal state behavior as your user defined functions.
```vue
<template>
  <button @click='fusion.sync'>Sync!</button>
  <div v-if='fusion.sync.processing'>
    Loading...
  </div>
</template>
```
To import it, you may use the `useFusion` function.
```vue
<script setup>
  import { useFusion } from "$fusion/Pages/Hello.js";

  // Import `name` only.
  const { fusion } = useFusion(['fusion']);
</script>
```
All that `sync` does is gather up the state from the frontend, send it to the backend, mounts the page, and then sends the state back out to the frontend to be applied.

You can imagine this might be useful if you had a simple search component that looks like this:

```vue
<php>
  use function \Fusion\prop;
  use \App\Models\Podcast;

  $search = prop('');
  $podcasts = prop(function() use ($search) {
      if ($search) {
        return Podcast::search($search)->get();
      }
      return Podcast::all();
  })->readonly();
</php>

<script>
  import Podcast from '@/Components/Podcast.vue'
  import LoadingIcon from '@/Components/LoadingIcon.vue'

  export default {
    components: {
      Podcast,
      LoadingIcon,
    }
  }
</script>

<template>
  <div class="p-6 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <input v-model='search' placeholder="Search podcasts" />
    <button @click='fusion.sync'>
      <LoadingIcon v-if="fusion.sync.inProgress" />
      <span v-else>Search</span>
    </button>

    <Podcast v-for="podcast in podcasts" v-bind="podcast" />
  </div>
</template>
```
In this example, we are sending a piece of state down with the name `search`. On the backend, we're using that `search` state to find podcasts that the user is looking for. When the page first loads, `search` will be a blank string, and so we'll send out all of the podcasts. If the user types something into the text box on the front, the local state of search will be updated, but it does not automatically sync to the backend.

When the user presses the button, we call `fusion.sync`, which is that magic function provided by Fusion. We'll send all the state to the backend. At this point, `search` is now a value, so we use that value to compute the value of `podcasts`, and we send `podcasts` and search back out to the frontend to be updated in the template.
